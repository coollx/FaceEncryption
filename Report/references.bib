This analysis is given from the perspective of European Union (EU) privacy protection with attention also given to USA law.The article starts with a short description of the techniques employed by Google and Facebook to collect and monetize their users’ personal data.The central part of this article examines the main privacy issues that arise through the use of personal data by Google and Facebook, such as the lack of valid consent given by their users, the insufficient access and control given to users over their personal information, and the risk of re-identification of anonymous personal data. Special reference is made to Google and Facebook’s privacy policies and the confusing information that they provide about the use of personal data.This article compares the different approaches of the EU and USA regarding privacy protection and describes the challenges that new technology development poses to the legislature regarding the protection of privacy.}",
