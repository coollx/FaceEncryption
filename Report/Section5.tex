\section{Modelling}

\subsection{Face Recognition}

Before we can achieve our objective, we need a face recognition system to use as an attacking target. To recognise faces, we employ a pre-trained ResNet-18 model in pytorch.
In the neuron network, we use cross entropy loss as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a simple yet highly effective method for fitting linear classifiers and regressors under convex loss functions, as the optimizer. The model is trained for 10 iterations on the CelebA-HQ dataset.

\subsection{PGD Attack}

To generate adversarial examples, we use the PGD attack \cite{madry2017towards}. In this project, we use the gradient of the loss function to generate adversarial examples. The attack is iterative and uses a step size to determine the size of the perturbation. The attack is also constrained by a maximum perturbation size.

\subsubsection{Non-targeted Attack}

In a non-targeted attack, the goal is to generate an adversarial example that is misclassified by the target model $A$. Which means we are \textbf{maximizing} the loss function with respect to the target class $A$. The attack is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a random noise tensor with the same shape as the input image.
    \item Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the noise tensor.
    \item Add the gradient to the noise tensor.
    \item Clip the noise tensor to the range $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$.
    \item Add the noise tensor to the input image.
    \item Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the model misclassifies the image.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Targeted Attack}

In a targeted attack, the goal is to generate an adversarial example that is misclassified $A$ by the target model and classified as a specific class $B$. All the steps are the same as in a non-targeted attack, except for the last step should be: \textbf{Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the model classifies it as the target class.} Which means we are \textbf{minimizing} the loss function with respect to the target class $B$.
