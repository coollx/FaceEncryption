\section{Introduction}

Big data privacy risks in public social media are confirmed by recent reports \cite{6227909}. The quantity of user-generated content being uploaded to the internet is growing quickly, yet some big companies, like Google and Facebook, have been abusing it without their knowledge \cite{10.1093/idpl/ipw026}. Privacy protection is challenging when users submit sensitive images of their faces. In order to train their machine learning algorithms, the corporation might use these photographs, which could result in privacy breaches. \textbf{How can we protect privacy when sharing facial images?}

In this project, we provide potential solution based on adversarial attacking and facial recognition technology to safeguard users' privacy. After identifying the face in the image using the facial recognition model, we encrypt the face with noise. The generated image can be as clear to the human eye as the original, but the facial recognition model will identify a different person in it.
